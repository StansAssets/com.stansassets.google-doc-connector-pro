# Google Doc Connector Pro
The plugin allows you to use Google Sheets as a configuration repository for your game. And also use Google Sheets as a repository for localization.
The plugin saves data from spreadsheets in json and uses data from them when building a project. In the Editor mode, you can synchronize and save all the necessary spreadsheets.

### Referencing packages from private repositories by SSH
Unity Package Manager supports referencing packages from private repositories by SSH, see an example:
`"com.company.app": "ssh://git@github.com/Company/app.git#X.Y.Z"`.
But easy to stumble if doing it the first time because Unity Package Manager requires the only SSH key without a passphrase. A quick guide to starting with:
* Start Git Bash and generate SSH key without a passphrase if you don't have one already. ([Git SSH Guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent))
* Add SSH key to an ssh-agent. Reboot PC.
* Create some temporary directory on a PC and go there by executing command `cd C:\Repositories\SSHTestRepository`. Clone repository that going to be referenced as a package with `git clone git@github.com/Company/app.git`, agree with adding to a hosts list.
* Done! Feel free to delete previously cloned repository.
